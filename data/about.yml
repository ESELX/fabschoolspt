  title: "How can Fablabs<br />impact education?"
  column1: "
    Fabschools invites you to imagine how a Fablab (Makerspace) can impact education. Even in schools where makerspaces or digital fabrication tools are nonexistent?
  "
  column2: "
    To do so, We invite creatives (makers, designers, artists) who traditionally inhabit the fablab and educators to collaborate.
The challenge is understanding how to use the production of the informal educational contexts of fablabs while working with teachers to extrapolate these to formal education environments.
