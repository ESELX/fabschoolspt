  title: "Alquimétricos is an open and collaborative collection"
  text: "of open source building blocks focused on affordable STEAM education for vulnerable communities. The flexible connectors allow to build geodesic domes as well as a plethora of structures with the aid of bamboo sticks and rubber bands. Recycled as well as virgin and alternative materials can be used to fabricate the connectors via laser cutter, CNC router, vinyl cutter plotters as well as handcraft tools like scissors and punch hole pliers. The 4-year-old project has evolved into an international community of makers, educators, social development agents and sharing economy enthusiasts that help polinizing the initiative among schools, cultural, permacultural and counter-cultural centers. The product blueprints as well as educational materials, business and branding model are completely open, so members can appropriate the contents and develop locally in a sustainable way.

  <h3>Education </h3><p>Alquimétricos is a collection of open source didactic building blocks that stimulate and promote education and learning.The initiative is focused on the design of DIY materials which are meant to be produced using a wide range of procedures.</p>
  <p>Alquimétricos is a really broad project and is interesting for multiple age groups as it can be explored in more and more complex ways and scales. Adaptable to several contexts it is designed to be used in schools as well as community activities or workshops.</p>
  <h3>Sustainability</h3><p>Files are shared digitally and it is designed to be produced using a wide range of local materials that only require local manufacturing.</p>
  
  <h3>SDG Profile (selected SDG’s)</h3>

  text: "<h3>Openness</h3><p>The author allows everyone to use the project at his own will as long as new forks credit the original work. You are encouraged to create derivative forms of this project and all the files are available online on multiple platforms.</p>
  <h3>Ecosystem</h3><p>This project can be bought from its creators if the user is not interested in producing it. It is easily produced in a Fablab using the available machines and materials as well as at home or in remote contexts using basic items and materials. Online platforms are a great partner as a way to share new approaches to the original project.</p>"
